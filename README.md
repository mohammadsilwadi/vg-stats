# vg-stats
Start two Jupyter Notebooks called vg-stats and bike-stats
Add a markdown cell at the top of each notebook with the title of this assignment, an appropriate name for the data set, as well as your name and the date
Load up each of these data sets into a Pandas DataFrame within each respective file.

    NOTE: There’s an issue with one of the CSV files. You will need to find a way to handle that error… Google it, and work around it!
